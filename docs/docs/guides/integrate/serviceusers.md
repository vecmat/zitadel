title: Service Users
---

This is a guide on how to create service users in ZITADEL. You can read more about users [here](/docs/concepts/structure/users).
## Create a Service User

1. Navigate to Service Users
2. Click on **New**
3. Enter a user name and a display name

## Authenticating a service user

In ZITADEL we use the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` (**“JWT bearer token with private key”**, [RFC7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523)) authorization grant for this non-interactive authentication.

You need to follow these steps to authenticate a service user and receive a access token:

1. Generate a private-public key pair in ZITADEL
2. Create a JSON Web Token (JWT) and sign with private key
3. With this JWT, request an OAuth token from ZITADEL

With this token you can make subsequent requests, just like a human user.

## Get an access token

In this step we will authenticate a service user and receive an access_token to use against a API.

### 1. Generate a private-public key pair in ZITADEL

Select your service user and in the section KEYS click **New**. Enter an expiration date and click **Add**. Make sure to download the json by clicking **Download**.

The downloaded json should look something like outlined below. The value of `key` contains the *private* key for your service account. Please make sure to keep this key securely stored and handle with care. The public key is automatically stored in ZITADEL.

```json
{
    "type":"serviceaccount",
    "keyId":"100509901696068329",
    "key":"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- [...] -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "userId":"100507859606888466"
}
```

### 2. Create a JWT and sign with private key

You need to create a JWT with the following header and payload and sign it with the RS256 algorithm.

Header

```json
{
    "alg": "RS256",
    "kid":"100509901696068329"
}
```

Make sure to include `kid` in the header with the value of `keyId` from the downloaded JSON.

Payload

```json
{
    "iss": "100507859606888466",
    "sub": "100507859606888466",
    "aud": "https://{your_domain}.zitadel.cloud",
    "iat": [Current UTC timestamp, e.g. 1605179982, max. 1 hour ago],
    "exp": [UTC timestamp, e.g. 1605183582]
}
```

* `iss` represents the requesting party, i.e. the owner of the private key. In this case the value of `userId` from the downloaded JSON.
* `sub` represents the application. Set the value also to the value of `userId`
* `aud` must be ZITADEL's issuing domain
* `iat` is a unix timestamp of the creation signing time of the JWT, e.g. now and must not be older than 1 hour ago
* `exp` is the unix timestamp of expiry of this assertion

Please refer to [JWT_with_Private_Key](../../apis/openidoauth/authn-methods#jwt-with-private-key) in the documentation for further information.

If you use Go, you might want to use the [provided tool](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-tools) to generate a JWT from the downloaded json. There are many [libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) to generate and sign JWT.

### 3. With this JWT, request an OAuth token from ZITADEL

With the encoded JWT from the prior step, you will need to craft a POST request to ZITADEL's token endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://{your_domain}.zitadel.cloud/oauth/v2/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer \
  --data scope='openid profile email' \
  --data assertion=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL...
```

* `grant_type` should be set to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`
* `scope` should contain any [Scopes](../../apis/openidoauth/scopes) you want to include, but must include `openid`. For this example, please include `profile` and `email`
* `assertion` is the encoded value of the JWT that was signed with your private key from the prior step

You should receive a successful response with `access_token`,  `token_type` and time to expiry in seconds as `expires_in`.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "access_token": "MtjHodGy4zxKylDOhg6kW90WeEQs2q...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 43199
}
```

### 4. Verify that you have a valid access token

For this example let's call the userinfo endpoint to verify that our access token works.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://{your_domain}.zitadel.cloud/oidc/v1/userinfo \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer MtjHodGy4zxKylDOhg6kW90WeEQs2q...'
```

You should receive a response with your service user's information.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "MyServiceUser",
  "preferred_username": "service_user@{your_domain}.zitadel.cloud",
  "updated_at": 1616417938
}
```

## Summary

* With service users you can secure machine-to-machine communication
* Because there is no interactive logon, you need to use a JWT signed with your private key to authorize the user
* After successful authorization you can use an access token like for human users

Where to go from here:

* Management API
* Securing backend API
